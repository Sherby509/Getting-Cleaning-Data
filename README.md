# Getting-Cleaning-DataCourse project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data" Feburary 2015.
The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones



The code takes the data from the URL and process it to make a working data set, it then makes changes following the assignment requirements as follows:
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. *Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. *Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set *Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. *From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps described above. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.
The output of the 5th step is called tidydata.txt that fullfils the requirements of described in the 5 steps and during the course.
